To run the webPageSimilarity.py file we just have to open the terminal where this file is saved. Now we just have to write command to run the file like:- 
"  python3 webPageSimilarity.py url1 url2 ngram-number"
url1 = Url of first web page for similarity check
url2 = Url of second web page for similarity check
ngram-number = is a integer value by we create ngrams form the content of web pages. Generally we use 4, 5, 6 or 7 any one value for better similarity.


We have to give three arguments other wise our code will not work.
