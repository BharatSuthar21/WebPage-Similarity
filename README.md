# Web Page Similarity Checker

This script, `webPageSimilarity.py`, calculates the similarity between two web pages using n-grams. The similarity is determined by comparing the content of the web pages, and the level of granularity can be adjusted by specifying the n-gram value.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system.
- Internet access to fetch the web pages for comparison.

## Usage

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where `webPageSimilarity.py` is located.
2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 webPageSimilarity.py <url1> <url2> <ngram-number>
